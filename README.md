My first project allowed me to work with lines and the basic shapes to create buildings using the line code along with the rectangle coding which I placed in both center and corner mode with the lines interweaving like the windows on a glass building with the no fill function just showing the background behind the building.

Project number 7 was my favorite project out of the group I've done over the year, it displays a school of fish swimming around in multiple colors thanks to the fish class displaying them as different sized triangles with the random function shoing their positions and colors as they move using the random function as an offset for the small movements.

My fourth program makes pizza with a pizza box to go with it using the keyboard functions with the 'a' and 's' keys adding the toppings to the pizza and the 'P' key to add the pizza box on top of the completed product with a simple mouse click telling the user to enjoy their pizza.

[Here's a link to code to make the pizza and the box.](https://github.com/Sonicgal970/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s20magd150lab04_Sobieski_2020_02_28_05_07_03/sketch.js)

The ninth program deals with reflective crystals which behave like mirrors since they reflect light, in order to make the light effect, I used a preload function to upload the video and a sound file to upload some crystal based music to accompany it with a reverb function making it reverb a bit while the program occurs.

[Here's a link to the crystal-mirror source code](https://github.com/Sonicgal970/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s20magd150_lab09_Sobieski_2020_04_21_16_14_43/sketch.js)

The second program was out of this world since it involved the theme of outer space and by using the ellipse and triangle functions I was able to form some planets and other spacial oddities while using the fill function to get the colors fit for the different objects relating to the world beyond the boundaries of our planet's atmosphere.

[Here's the link to the code that's out of this world.](https://github.com/Sonicgal970/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s20magd150lab02_Sobieski_2020_02_13_01_09_33/sketch.js)
