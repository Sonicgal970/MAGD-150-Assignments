My first project allowed me to work with lines and the basic shapes to create buildings using the line code along with the rectangle coding which I placed in both center and corner mode with the lines interweaving like the windows on a glass building with the no fill function just showing the background behind the building.

Project number 7 was my favorite project out of the group I've done over the year, it displays a school of fish swimming around in multiple colors thanks to the fish class displaying them as different sized triangles with the random function shoing their positions and colors as they move using the random function as an offset for the small movements.
