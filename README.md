My first project allowed me to work with lines and the basic shapes to create buildings using the line code along with the rectangle coding which I placed in both center and corner mode with the lines interweaving like the windows on a glass building with the no fill function just showing the background behind the building.

One of my favorite projects was the seventh project where I had to create my own class of fish to fit the aspect of nature and with the random movements making it look like they're moving while using the same object to randomize the different colors of the fish with the blue background acting like the water with the tan ground being the sand.

The ninth project involves the mirrors and yet I considered crystals as mirrors because they're just as reflective and shiny as the mirrors in our houses with the glowing light coming from the rainbow crystal on the floor of the cavern with the crystal music playing in the background making the room feel unique and special.
